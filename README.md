# Centercode_2_Bugzilla
I created a tool for work to get information from Centercode and create a bug in Bugzilla. It utilizes a complicated process by which Centercode sends an email to Microsoft Outlook. Outlook then triggers this script. This script then parses the information and fills out a template for the bug.

Will update more on this later.
